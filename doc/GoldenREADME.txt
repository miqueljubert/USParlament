                                        GOLDEN PARTITION ReadMe
                                       -------------------------

    The Golden partition is based on a congress of 45 members which may vote about the abolishing of death penalty in
any country of the States. We are taking into consideration the following MPs attributes:

         Attribute name          Importance value
    -----------------------      ----------------
    Official Position               High
    Prison lobby influence          High
    Party                           Medium
    Religion                        Medium
    State location                  Medium
    Has he/she children?            Medium
    Gender                          Low
    Studies                         Low
    Age                             Low
    Guns possession opinion         Low

    So, with these definitions, we expect to obtain a partition with three communities: ones with official position =
YES, no prison lobby influence and party = DEM; others with official position = NO and prison lobby influence = YES; and
finally the ones without prison lobby influence and party = REP. The MPs which do not have defined value for its official
position will be distributed thanks to its medium-importance values.
